# About my project: "LA County Restaurant Inspection Scores and Community Health"

## Brief Introduction

Los Angeles County provides openly available data on all restaurant and market inspections over the past 5 years. Facilities are subject to inspection 1 to 3 times a year, and made public within 1 week of inspection date. The frequency in which restaurants and food markets are inspected depends on the public health risk associated with the food products served or prepared and on the facility's history of inspection grades. Inspectors deduct points based on violations and health risks, which is turned into a score out of 100. 

First, I examined all of the restaurants in the data set and calculated average inspection scores in each city to compare with its public health outcomes (Diabetes, Obesity, Depression). Then, I examined a subset of the restaurant inspection data (all McDonald's, Jack in the Box, Starbucks, El Pollo Loco, Panda Express, Taco Bell, Del Taco, In N Out, Panera Bread) and examined the geospatial correlation between restaurant inspection rating and its community health status.
