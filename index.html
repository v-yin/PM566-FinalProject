<h1>Brief Introduction</h1>
<p>Los Angeles County provides openly available data on all restaurant
and market inspections over the past 5 years. Facilities are subject to
inspection 1 to 3 times a year, and made public within 1 week of
inspection date. The frequency in which restaurants and food markets are
inspected depends on the public health risk associated with the food
products served or prepared and on the facility’s history of inspection
grades. Inspectors deduct points based on violations and health risks,
which is turned into a score out of 100.</p>
<p>First, I examined all of the restaurants in the data set and
calculated average inspection scores in each city to compare with its
public health outcomes. Then, I examined a subset of the restaurant
inspection data (all McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, Starbucks, El Pollo
Loco, Panda Express, Taco Bell, Del Taco, In N Out, Panera Bread) and
examined the geospatial correlation between restaurant inspection rating
and its community health status.</p>
<p>In total, there were 252773 inspections of 39423 restaurants in 66
cities within LA County.</p>
<p>Of the 252773 inspections included in the analysis, the average grade
was 93.94 with a standard deviation of 3.87. The highest score was a
perfect score, 100 whereas the lowest score was 54.</p>
